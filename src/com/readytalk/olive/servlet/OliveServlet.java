/**
 * So tomcat will forward any request here that meets a certain pattern.
 * 
 * To tell tomcat how to do this, you will want to setup the web.xml file.
 * 
 * Web.xml is filled with what Sun(now Oracle) calls "deployment descriptors"
 * that tell tomcat about the code you wrote. It tells tomcat how to direct
 * requests and where resources are located.
 * 
 * So these are the entries I made for this Servlet under the WEB-INF directory,
 * in web.xml.
 * 
 * First, I have to tell the web container about my servlet, so it can be called
 * by a shorter name elsewhere in the config file:
 * 
 * <servlet> <servlet-name>OliveServlet</servlet-name>
 * <servlet-class>com.readytalk.olive.servlet.OliveServlet</servlet-class>
 * </servlet>
 * 
 * That was easy enough, but now I have to tell the container what requests
 * should go here. This isn't the easiest thing to explain, so look at the XML
 * first:
 * 
 * <servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>OliveServlet</servlet-name>
 * <url-pattern>/OliveServlet</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping>
 * 
 * This means that if tomcat is runnint at olive.readytalk.com and our root
 * context (see the other .xml file in the WEB-INF directory... that is the
 * "sun-web.xml" for more on this) is "MattsBadExample" (which it is), then any
 * requests directed to http://olive.readytalk.com/MattsBadExample/OliveServlet
 * will be mapped to this class.
 * 
 * Of course, in the index.jsp file we only refer to it locally (as index.jsp
 * sits at the root of our application, in terms of URL structure).
 * 
 * I hope that makes sense. So if you make a new Serlvet class you want a form
 * on a jsp page to reference, you must first give it a short name for the
 * container (which can actually be anything) and then you will want to map that
 * to a URL. The servlet-name values have to match, but the url-pattern and
 * servlet name can be anything, the servlet-class just has to point at the
 * fully qualified class name. That is the name of the package + the class.
 * 
 * These entries would be perfectly valid:
 * 
 * <servlet> <servlet-name>NotMyServletsNameAtAll</servlet-name>
 * <servlet-class>com.readytalk.olive.servlet.OliveServlet</servlet-class>
 * </servlet>
 * 
 * And
 * 
 * <servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>NotMyServletsNameAtAll</servlet-name>
 * <url-pattern>/What</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping>
 * 
 * This, however, is confusing, but just illustrating a point. It is practice to
 * not do this but keep it as I have.
