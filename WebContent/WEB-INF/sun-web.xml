<!-- What is this file??????????? This is pretty simple, it just tells tomcat 
	what my application is called. There are other things in here, but for now 
	this is what you need to know. The "context root" is what goes after your 
	base URL. i.e. if Tomcat is running at olive.readytalk.com, then the root 
	context (or context-root) would make the URL to this application: http://olive.readytalk.com/olive/ 
	That would put you at the index.jsp. -->
